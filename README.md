# Hexagon lamp notes

Currently there are two sub-dirs

## simplefoc_tuning
Intended as the first draft of the tuning and connection sketch
I'm implementing the communication protocol and state management as well as the FOC tuning with SimpleFOC

## device_helpers
Kind of the "devops" of the device:
- compilation
- upload
- debug and testing scripts
-
